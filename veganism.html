            <h1>Introduction to Veganism</h1>
            <h2>What is veganism</h2>
            <p>Veganism is a way of life that tries to cause as little suffering as possible to animals and other
                 sentient beings. It is centered on animals because, in the world,  they are currently treated as
                  commodities and they go through gruesome, appalling exploitation at the hands of humans.
                   To achieve its goals, it eliminates any animal products from the human diet and also tries
                    to eliminate from the human lifestyle any products or services based on animal exploitation,
                     such as items of clothing made of leather or shows with trained animals.</p>
            <h2>Types of veganism</h2>
            <p>Seeing as there is no central authority that governs veganism and that the requirements for becoming
                 a vegan are pretty broad, different branches of veganism formed soon enough. Often, they do not
                  agree with one another and do not even acknowledge each other as “real vegans”.</p>
            <h3>Ethical vegans or vegans for the animals</h3>
            <div class="veg-img"><img src="images/ethical.jpg" alt="Grafitti of ethical veganism"></div>
            <p>These people care about animals first and foremost. They want to end animal exploitation, tend to
                 seek the company of other vegans, are well organized and consider veganism a definitory part of
                  their personality. They want to spread the message that people do not need meat to survive and that 
                eating meat is immoral since it exploits animals for human greed. For them, animals live only for themselves
            and they should be granted certain rights.</p>
            <h3>Vegans for the environment</h3>
            <div class="veg-img"><img src="images/environment.jpg" alt="Lanscape of windmills"></div>
            <p>Usually these vegans are also part of the first group. They see animal exploitation as a threat not
                 only to animals, but for all life on earth. They try to make people aware of the danger of greenhouse
                 emissions and the role that animal farming has on the production of CO2. They are often anti-consumerists 
                and they highlight the impact that garbage that can't be recycled has on wildlife. They are also concerned with 
            the extinction of animal species as a direct result of human activity.</p>
            <h3>Vegans for health or plant-based vegans</h3>
            <div class="veg-img"><img src="images/health.jpg" alt="Fit man in a gym preparing protein shake"></div>
            <p>While not totally indifferent to animal suffering, these vegans don’t want to be associated with any
                 form of militancy. They are mainly preoccupied with the impact of animal products on human health. They claim 
                that, because the way animals meant for food are raised, in unhygienic conditions and pumped full of 
            antibiotics, meat from farm animals is not safe for human consumption. Thy also praise the curative properties
        of plants and they think that humans eating mostly plants will have a longer life and a healthier body.</p>
            <h3>Raw-vegans</h3>
            <div class="veg-img"><img src="images/raw.jpg" alt="Plate full of raw vegetables"></div>
            <p>These people see food that doesn’t need to be cooked as the healthiest possible food and, in
                 consequence, refuse animal products, which need to be prepared on a fire in order to be safe to
                  consume. They have to eat copious amounts of food in order to get all of their nutrients. It is one 
                of the most challenging vegan diets as raw vegans need to invest a lot of money in their food and 
            a lot of time in preparing it. There are also critics that say some vegetables are actually healthier 
        if they are cooked before being consumed.</p>
            <h3>Vegetarians</h3>
            <div class="veg-img"><img src="images/vegetarian.jpg" alt="Bread, milk, cheese, egg and apple on a table"></div>
            <p>A lot of vegans start off as vegetarians, at first cutting out just meat from their diet, but
                 continuing to eat milk and eggs. It is one of the most well-represented group and there are many vegetarian
                 cuisines around the world. Some people would not consider vegetarians as coming under the same category
                 as vegans, since milk and eggs still come from animal exploitation. However, there are others who claim that 
                 being vegan is about causing the least possible harm and that causing just a little less harm is still better than 
                 not caring at all.
            </p>
            <h3>Pescetarians</h3>
            <div class="veg-img"><img src="images/pescetarian.jpg" alt="Fish dish on a plate"></div>
            <p>Just like vegetarians, but also eating fish, arguing that fish have smaller brains and somehow feel
                 less. This is very debatable and, as with vegetarians, most vegans would not consider pescetarians as having
                 anything to do with veganism. However, the principle of "as little harm as one cand manage to do" still applies,
                 and pescetarianism is often just a step towards vegetarianism and veganism.      
            </p>
            <h3>Purity vegans</h3>
            <div class="veg-img"><img src="images/purity.jpg" alt="Nun walking by a river"></div>
            <p>These are vegans who do not understand what is keeping other people from going vegan. They have a
                 very high standard for veganism and they exclude people who give in to cravings as “not real vegans”.
                 They receive a lot of criticism from vegans and non-vegans alike, because they make veganism seem to be
                 more about moral duty than a choice to be compassionate and kind. They may also come across as hypocritical, 
                 since very few people are born vegan and they seem to foget where they started.
            </p>
            <h3>Flexetarian</h3>
            <div class="veg-img"><img src="images/flexetarian.jpg" alt="Landscape with signpost in multiple directions"></div>
            <p>They are the opposite of purity vegans, in the sense that they think human beings are imperfect and
                 they value every effort someone makes to reduce suffering of animals, no matter how small the effort. They think 
                 that people who cannot give up certain foods should not worry too much about it and just give up whatever they can,
                 as it will certainly have an impact. They are also against forcing or shaming anyone into being vegan, 
                 thinking that the power of example and human empathy will prevail.
            </p>
            <h3>Freegans</h3>
            <div class="veg-img"><img src="images/freegans.jpg" alt="Worker throwing food into a bin"></div>
            <p>Also uncharitably called “dumpster-vegans”, they are vegans who will eat non-vegan food that will go to
                 waste anyway. They are people who live with non-vegans and are happy to eat non-vegan food that is left over or 
                 to consume free food close to the expiery date. 
            </p>
            <h2>How to become a vegan</h2>
            <p>As we have seen from the many different ways a person can be vegan, there are no strict rules. The very
                 least is a desire to reduce the suffering of animals, if not to end it. </p>
            <p>Passing from intent to actions, the first logical step is to reduce meat consumption. Vegans find the
                 term “humane killing” very unsavory and just a marketing ploy from meat companies. So ditching meat
                  is essential, even if you don’t do it immediately.
                The next step is letting go of other animal products, like milk and cheese. As it has been proven that
                 cheese is addictive, it might not be very easy. It still needs to be done, as the lives of cows on
                  dairy farms and the lives of chicken in batteries is pure torture.
                </p>
            <p>Moving on, you need to educate yourself about nutrition. You need to combine plant based meals so that
                 you get your minerals and protein. Protein is actually very easy to get from plants, but you need to
                  prioritize some foods, like legumes. Also, don’t forget to take your B12 from supplements.</p>
            <p>The next step would be to stop buying leather, wool, feather based pillows and other products that
                 involve the killing of an animal. </p>
