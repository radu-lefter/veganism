            <h1>Introduction to Veganism</h1>
            <h2>What is veganism</h2>
            <p>Veganism is a way of life that tries to cause as little suffering as possible to animals and other sentient beings. It is centered on animals because, in the world,  they are currently treated as commodities and they go through gruesome, appalling exploitation at the hands of humans. To achieve its goals, it eliminates any animal products from the human diet and also tries to eliminate from the human lifestyle any products or services based on animal exploitation, such as items of clothing made of leather or shows with trained animals.</p>
            <h2>Types of veganism</h2>
            <p>Seeing as there is no central authority that governs veganism and that the requirements for becoming a vegan are pretty broad, different branches of veganism formed soon enough. Often, they do not agree with one another and do not even acknowledge each other as “real vegans”.</p>
            <h3>Ethical vegans or vegans for the animals</h3>
            <div class="veg-img"><img src="images/ethical.jpg" alt=""></div>
            <p>These people care about animals first and foremost. They want to end animal exploitation, tend to seek the company of other vegans, are well organized and consider veganism a definitory part of their personality.</p>
            <h3>Vegans for the environment</h3>
            <div class="veg-img"><img src="images/environment.jpg" alt=""></div>
            <p>Usually these vegans are also part of the first group. They see animal exploitation as a threat not only to animals, but for all life on earth.</p>
            <h3>Vegans for health or plant-based vegans</h3>
            <div class="veg-img"><img src="images/health.jpg" alt=""></div>
            <p>While not totally indifferent to animal suffering, these vegans don’t want to be associated with any form of militancy. They are mainly preoccupied with the impact of animal products on human health. </p>
            <h3>Raw-vegans</h3>
            <div class="veg-img"><img src="images/raw.jpg" alt=""></div>
            <p>These people consider food that doesn’t need to be cooked as the healthiest possible food and, in consequence, refuse animal products, which need to be prepared on a  fire in order to be safe to consume.</p>
            <h3>Vegetarians</h3>
            <div class="veg-img"><img src="images/vegetarian.jpg" alt=""></div>
            <p>A lot of vegans start off as vegetarians, at first cutting out just meat from their diet, but continuing to eat milk and eggs. It is one of the most well-represented group. 
            </p>
            <h3>Pescetarians</h3>
            <div class="veg-img"><img src="images/pescetarian.jpg" alt=""></div>
            <p>Just like vegetarians, but also eating fish, arguing that fish have smaller brains and somehow feel less. 
            </p>
            <h3>Purity vegans</h3>
            <div class="veg-img"><img src="images/purity.jpg" alt=""></div>
            <p>These are vegans who do not understand what is keeping other people from going vegan. They have a very high standard for veganism and they exclude people who give in to cravings as “not real vegans”.
            </p>
            <h3>Flexetarian</h3>
            <div class="veg-img"><img src="images/flexetarian.jpg" alt=""></div>
            <p>They are the opposite of purity vegans, in the sense that they think human beings are imperfect and they value every effort someone makes to reduce suffering of animals, no matter how small the effort.
            </p>
            <h3>Freegans</h3>
            <div class="veg-img"><img src="images/freegans.jpg" alt=""></div>
            <p>Also uncharitably called “dumpster-vegans”, they are vegans who will eat non-vegan food that will go to waste anyway.
            </p>
            <h2>How to become a vegan</h2>
            <p>As we have seen from the many different ways a person can be vegan, there are no strict rules. The very least is a desire to reduce the suffering of animals, if not to end it. </p>
            <p>Passing from intent to actions, the first logical step is to reduce meat consumption. Vegans find the term “humane killing” very unsavory and just a marketing ploy from meat companies. So ditching meat is essential, even if you don’t do it immediately.
                The next step is letting go of other animal products, like milk and cheese. As it has been proven that cheese is addictive, it might not be very easy. It still needs to be done, as the lives of cows on dairy farms and the lives of chicken in batteries is pure torture.
                </p>
            <p>Moving on, you need to educate yourself about nutrition. You need to combine plant based meals so that you get your minerals and protein. Protein is actually very easy to get from plants, but you need to prioritize some foods, like legumes. Also, don’t forget to take your B12 from supplements.</p>
            <p>The next step would be to stop buying leather, wool, feather based pillows and other products that involve the killing of an animal. </p>
