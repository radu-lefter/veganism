                <p>People often forget that every piece of nicely packaged meat with
                    images of happy animals on it comes from an actually living being.
                    Here's a calculator to help you put the impact of your diet into perspective.</p>
                <p>You can introduce the amount of meat you eat per week in kilograms and the
                    calculator will tell you how many animals are sacrificed per year. It also tells
                    you how many animals you could save if you ate half as much meat. It doesn't have to be exact, 
                    an estimate is fine. Note that we will 
                not save the results and they will be deleted as soon as the page refreshes.</p><br><br>
              
                <label for="beef">How many kg of beef do you eat every week?</label>
                <input id="beef" name="beef" type="number"><br>
                <label for="pork">How many kg of pork do you eat every week?</label>
                <input id="pork" name="pork" type="number"><br>
                <label for="lamb">How many kg of lamb do you eat every week?</label>

                <label for="chicken">How many kg of chicken do you eat every week?</label>

                  <p>As you can see, the results are very roughly estimated. Below you can find
                       the data we used to calculate the results. They are based on the average
                        weight of the carcass of a slaughtered animal. We used the most popular 
                        kinds of animals, there are many other kinds of animals that people consume,
                        depending on the country and culture, even animals that you may consider pets.
                        We aslo have to keep in mind that there are many breeds and that not all animals
                        weigh the same.</p>
