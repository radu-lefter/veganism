            <h3>Who are we</h3>
            <p>We are a team of one passionate about veganism and about reducing animal suffering in the world.
                 I created this site so that people can get more information about veganism and the huge impact
                  they can make just by eating a little less meat.</p>
            <h3>Our mission</h3>
            <p> Our mission is to inform and challenge people to think about human and animal life and suffering. 
                We are not here to pressure or to shame. We just want to make you are aware that all you have to do to
                 create a better world is to reduce your meat consumption. You can be responsible for there being 
                more happy animals living here with us and less potential animals born into a life of misery and 
                pain. By changing your eating habits just a little, you are basically a hero for an animal out 
                there and you can achieve this status by doing less!</p>
