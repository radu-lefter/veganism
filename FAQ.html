            <div class="answer">
                <div class="gifs"><img src="images/im_sick.gif" alt="Gif of woman coughing"></div>
                <p>A vegan and a non-vegan diet both have the potential to make you sick if they are
                     not balanced. You should always pay attention to what you eat, so that your body
                      gets all the nutrients it needs. Also, some foods, because they are high in sugar
                       and in cholesterol, can damage your health when consumed in excess.</p>
                <p>When eating a plant based diet, the only challenge may be eating a varied diet so
                     that you get all the nutrients you need, but most people find this a perk of going
                      vegan.</p>

            <button type="button" class="question" id="question2" onclick="revealAnswer(this)">Do animals even feel pain?</button>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>Here’s a Wikipedia article that you’ll never read: 
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_consciousness#Cambridge_Declaration_on_Consciousness" target="_blank">Animal consciousness</a>.</p>
                <p>The main thing to take from it is that in 2012 a group of neuroscientists have signed 
                    the Cambridge Declaration on Consciousness, which states that animals have a brain 
                    that has evolved enough to experience consciousness.</p>
                <p>Humans and animals have very similar nervous systems. The fact that animals feel pain 
                    is undeniable. Recent studies have convinced us that they feel physical pain as well 
                    as emotional pain, they understand the loss of a loved one and the loss of freedom.</p>
                <p>This was easily known already intuitively. But we have to remember that people invent 
                    reasons to justify a wrong that brings them gain. The same way some humans were 
                    dehumanized in order to be exploited, animals are objectified in order to be exploited.</p>
            </div>
            <button type="button" class="question" id="question3" onclick="revealAnswer(this)">Don’t plants feel pain too? Why should we favor 
                animals over plants?</button>
            <div class="answer">
                <div class="gifs"><img src="images/crying_tree.gif" alt="Gif of tree crying"></div>
                <p>Plants do respond to stimuli and they might well feel at a certain level. We should 
                    continue studying them. However, we do know they do not have a central nervous system
                     and do not experience pain the same way we and animals do. Indeed, it would be counter
                      intuitive for plants to develop the same awareness of pain as we do, since they cannot run from danger.</p>
                <p>By all means, do not let this discourage you from becoming a plant activist. Trees 
                    nowadays need our help more than ever. Consuming fruit and nuts does not actually 
                    harm the tree. Cereal and vegetables are harvested at the end of the plant life. 
                    If you want to invest yourself in making sure that people eat mature spinach instead 
                    of baby spinach, you shouldn’t let people bring you down. Caring about humans,
                     animals and plants don’t need to exclude each other.</p>

            <button type="button" class="question" id="question4" onclick="revealAnswer(this)">Do vegans have to supplement all their lives?</button>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>Yes and no. You can get most of your vitamins and minerals from plants. However, 
                    you won’t find everything you need in just one plant, so this is why eating a varied
                     diet is so important.  What you can’t get enough of is vitamin B12 so yes, you will 
                     have to supplement for it all your life. This may sound daunting, but all it takes 
                     is a few drops every week. You don’t forget to brush your teeth every day, do you?</p>

            <button type="button" class="question" id="question5" onclick="revealAnswer(this)">Isn’t it human nature to eat meat?</button>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>This is an “appeal to normality” logical fallacy. There is a very long list of morally 
                    unacceptable human behaviours that were the norm back in the day. Just because everyone
                     does it, doesn’t mean it’s good or even harmless.</p>
                <p>Humans are omnivorous, they have evolved to eat meat and plants. That means we have a 
                    choice of what to eat.</p>

            <button type="button" class="question" id="question6" onclick="revealAnswer(this)">Don’t cows give milk anyway?</button>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>No, they do not. Just like humans, cows and any other animal need to get pregnant
                     in order to produce milk. This means that cows are constantly pregnant, after being
                      forcefully impregnated. The surplus in calves means that a lot of their babies are
                       killed soon after. </p>
            </div>
            <button type="button" class="question" id="question7" onclick="revealAnswer(this)">Don’t hens lay eggs anyway?</button>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>This isn’t  black and white issue as much as the production of milk is. The domesticated
                     chickens we have today were created through selective breeding so that they lay as 
                     many eggs as possible. Even if they can’t help themselves laying eggs, it doesn’t 
                     mean this doesn’t deplete their bodies or that it doesn’t cause them suffering.</p>
                <p>Birds in the wild lay about 10 eggs a year. Humans have created birds that lay almost 
                    every day (300 eggs a year). Even if we kept these birds in the best conditions 
                    (which we don’t, far from it), it’s not moral to keep breeding them for a body that 
                    condemns them to a life of pain.</p>

            <button type="button" class="question" id="question8" onclick="revealAnswer(this)">What is there even left to eat?</button>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>Just about anything you want, nowadays. Although it was most challenging in the past, 
                    today there are many commercial options for vegan food. There are plenty of substitutes
                     for meat and dairy. Any dish under the sun can be made vegan by substituting some of
                      the ingredients. Depending on the cook, the ingredients and the intent, you might not
                       know the difference.</p>
                <p>A lot of people see veganism as an opportunity to try new foods and acquire new tastes.
                     People only eat a fraction of the fruit, vegetables, nuts and cereal available to them.</p>

            <button type="button" class="question" id="question9" onclick="revealAnswer(this)">Is veganism a religion?</button>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>The underlying idea of veganism is causing as little suffering as possible to other
                     sentient beings. A lot of religions claim it, but they are pretty bad at putting it
                      into practice. However, veganism has no doctrine, no canon, no holy book, 
                      no revelation, no rituals and no clergy. You can be vegan and not tell anyone, 
                      if this makes it a religion, I personally wish there were more religions like this.</p>

            <button type="button" class="question" id="question10" onclick="revealAnswer(this)">Why are vegans trying to impose their lifestyle on 
                others?</button>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>Do they though?</p>
                <div class="gifs"><img src="images/isitthough.gif" alt="Gif of actor asking 'is it though?'"></div>
                <p>There are militant vegans out there, that is true. And they would probably make eating 
                    meat illegal, if they could.</p>
                <div class="gifs"><img src="images/galadriel.gif" alt="Gif of angry Galadriel"></div>
                <p>I’m joking, they are actually against violence.  But why does any group of people, any 
                    ideology, any political or philosophical school try to push their ideas? Because they 
                    think it is the right path. Vegans are trying to save animals, not to restrict your diet.</p> 
                <p>Most vegans do not even try to do that. They just try to change the world through personal,
                     individual actions, by only restricting their diet. </p>
                <p>If anyone tries to impose anything on you, you should challenge them, ask them questions and
                     make up your own mind, who knows, maybe vegans are wrong and they are just trying to make
                      a world with less suffering for nothing.</p>
